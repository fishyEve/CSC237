 *  This doxygen holds the documentation for a total of 3 files: BinarySearchTree.h , BinarySearchTree.cpp , Treetest.cpp . 
 *  BinarySearchTree.h is a header file that contains the definition for two classes: TreeNode and BinaryTree. TreeNode is 
 *  the definition for a node object to be used in the tree. BinaryTree is the definition for the binary tree object that
 *  holds all of the tree nodes. BinarySearchTree.cpp is the application file of BinarySearchTree.h , holding all of the code
 *  for the multiple function definitions. Finally, Treetest.cpp is the application for the BinarySearchTree itself, operating
 *  through a user-driven menu with different options to manipulate the binary tree. These options include adding, removing, 
 *  printing, printing the tree hiearchy, and quitting.
